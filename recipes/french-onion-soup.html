        <h2>For the Souop</h2>

                <li>4 large yellow onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup dry white wine (optional)</li>
                <li>8 cups beef or vegetable broth</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>For the Gratinee</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Baguette slices, toasted</li>
                <li>Gruyère cheese, grated</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Caramelize the Onions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by melting butter and olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the thinly sliced onions and let them cook gently, stirring occasionally, until they turn a beautiful golden brown. This process takes patience, so don't rush it! Sprinkle sugar over the onions to help them caramelize evenly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Layer the Flavors:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the onions are perfectly caramelized, add minced garlic and let it cook for an additional minute.</li>
                        <li>If you're using white wine, pour it in and let it simmer for a few minutes, allowing the alcohol to evaporate and leaving behind its delightful essence.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Develop the broth
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pour in the beef or vegetable broth, and add the bay leaves for that distinctive aromatic touch.</li>
                        <li>Let the soup simmer for about 30-40 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and create a harmonious symphony of taste.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Add the Seasonings
                    <ul>
                        <li>Season the soup with salt and freshly ground black pepper to your liking. Remember, a little at a time, taste, and adjust until it's just right.</li>
                        <li>The broth should be rich and savory, with the sweetness of the onions shining through.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Gratinee:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preheat your oven's broiler.</li>
                        <li>Ladel the soup into oven-safe bowls and float a few toasted baguette slices on top.</li>
                        <li>Generously sprinkle a mound of grated Gruyère cheese over each bowl, ensuring it covers the surface evenly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Broil:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Place the bowls on a baking sheet and slide them under the broiler until the cheese is bubbly, golden, and irresistibly gooey. Keep a close eye on them to prevent any burnt mishaps!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Serve:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Carefully remove the bowls from the oven (they'll be hot!), and let them cool for a minute or two. Dive in with a spoon, breaking through the cheesy crust to unearth the flavorful, onion-infused broth beneath.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
