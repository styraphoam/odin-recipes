                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt.</li>
                        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight for maximum flavor.</li>

                <li>Cook the Chicken:

                        <li>Place the marinated chicken on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred. Set aside.</li>
